# STAREX Cross Chain Blockchain Game

Welcome to the STAREX Blockchain Game repository! This project explores the concept of CROSS-CHAIN gaming and aims to provide a unique gaming experience across various blockchain networks, while it requires deployment of a set of smart contracts to each network for token wrapping and system integration.
The cross-chain feature is not limited on blockchain only but also implemented in-the action gameplay on portal dimension. Stay tune for our [game-vlogs](https://www.youtube.com/@theras_labs/videos)

We are adopting a hybrid system and are not fully decentralized yet. This decision has been made to expedite the release process and streamline development, with a primary focus on the adoption of 2-3 networks during the first season. The hackathon is intended to provide exposure and secure additional funding to accelerate progress in other departments.

> However, we have plans to migrate towards interoperability with other protocols, such as LayerZero, Wormhole, and ChainLINK CCIP in the future.

## OPEN SOURCE

We are planning to open-source some of our systems that can be reused in other web gaming systems, with the hope that everyone can use it in their web-game and grow together. These open-source libraries is already used in our Theras's games, which adopted by STAREX game and the HYAPE party.

- [**Customizable-ui:**](https://theras.xyz/open-sources) Open source of a feature to allow users to rearrange and adjust the placement of in-game buttons, menus, and other interface elements to suit their preferences. By empowering players to design their own UI layout, we ensure that everyone can enjoy a gaming experience that is not only immersive but also optimized for their specific device and comfort."

- [**ECS-on-gameplay:**](https://theras.xyz/open-sources) implementation of ECS architecture for web-game based layer.

- [**Graphic-manger:**](https://theras.xyz/open-sources) Automated graphic control and custom manger based on device's gpu

## Project Overview

STAREX joined multiple hackathons to showcase the concept of CROSS-CHAIN gaming and gain exposure globally. The project began in early November 2023, with concept exploration and the research starting since June 2023.

### Purpose

The primary goal is to contribute to the blockchain gaming ecosystem and web-game with the rising of WEBGPU.
The STAREX gameplay involving several experiments with cross-chain interactions.

### Security and Concept Risks

Due to security and concept risks, caution is advised when exploring or implementing features. Always consider the implications of changes, especially in the context of blockchain technology.

### Game-App Development Approach

In anticipation of security concerns for the upcoming publication, the game-app development will be divided into modular tools or packages. This approach allows for showcasing updates in abilities, controls, and other aspects, ensuring continuous progress during the hackathon. The demonstrated modules will be designed for easy integration, providing a plug-and-play experience for future development.

### Future Plans

In the future, an open-source repository named "map-maker" will be introduced as well to the community. This repository will empower community members to contribute to the game's expansive world by creating maps. Contributors may receive points from the DAO community and potentially be rewarded with royalties or other incentives.

This initiative is inspired by games like Warcraft, where user-generated content significantly enhances the gaming experience.
