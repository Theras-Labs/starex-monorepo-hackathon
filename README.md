## Project Overview

STAREX joined multiple hackathons to showcase the concept of CROSS-CHAIN gaming and gain exposure globally. The project began in early November 2023, with concept exploration and the research starting since June 2023.

### Purpose

The primary goal is to contribute to the blockchain gaming ecosystem and experiment with cross-chain interactions.

### Security and Concept Risks

Due to security and concept risks, caution is advised when exploring or implementing features. Always consider the implications of changes, especially in the context of blockchain technology.

### Game-App Development Approach

In anticipation of security concerns for the upcoming publication, the game-app development will be divided into modular tools or packages. This approach allows for showcasing updates in abilities, controls, and other aspects, ensuring continuous progress during the hackathon. The demonstrated modules will be designed for easy integration, providing a plug-and-play experience for future development.

### Future Plans

In the future, an open-source repository named "map-maker" will be introduced to the community. This repository will empower community members to contribute to the game's expansive world by creating maps. Contributors may receive points from the DAO community and potentially be rewarded with royalties or other incentives.

This initiative is inspired by games like Warcraft, where user-generated content significantly enhances the gaming experience.
